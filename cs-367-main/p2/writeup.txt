Project 2

1. As far as I can tell all aspects of the server and client code are working. The only thing I didn't have time to do was include
   the byte conversions (nton or ntoh), but it should be fine since in use the same machine is running both sides.
2. To test my code I ran the code in 2 windows to make sure that the fork was working and the games would interfere with each other.
3. The most challenging aspect of this project for me was being stuck while is was using two sends in a row in a loop which
   resulted in the sent data getting grumpy with each other jarbling the recieved data.
